# This is sample of ibp server configuration file. The ibp 
# server configuration file provides defaults for users and 
# the values can be change 
#
###########################################################
# From version 1.4.0, IBP depot begins to support multiple storage
# resources. Currently, memory and disk storage are supported.
# For each resource, user need to define following entries:
#
# RESOURCEID:
#    Define the resource number  which is used to 
#    identify the source uniquely. Multiple RESOURCEID can be
#    defined in the configure file. The resource with  RESOURCESID 0 
#    in the config file is the default resource of the depot.
# RSTYPE:
#    Define the resource type. It's either "DISK" or "MEMORY"
# LOCATION:
#    Specify the storage directory. It's only applied to disk resource.
# HARDSIZE:
#    The amount of stable storage. The default unit of size is MByte,and
#    'b' or 'B' for bytes, 'm' or 'M' for Mbytes, 'g' or 'G' for GBytes.
# SOFTSIZE:
#    The size of total storage. The default unit of size is MBytes, and 
#    'b' or 'B' for bytes, 'm' or 'M' for Mbytes, 'g' or 'G' for GBytes.
# MINFREESIZE:
#    The minimal size of free storage. 
# MAXDURATION:
#    The maximum possible duration for a newly allocated storage. -1 for
#    no limit.
# ZEROCONF:
#    1 to enable zeroconf to broadcast the resource on local network. 0 to disable.
#    Default value is 1.
# DATADIRS
#    Number of data folders to hold IBP allocations. ( maximum 512). Default is 16
# RESOURCE_END
#    End of resource configuration.
# For each RESOURCEID, it must be followed by SOFTSIZE, HARDSIZE,
# MINFREESIZE, TYPE, LOCATION,MAXDURATION without other entries among 
# them and end with RESOURCE_END entry. 
# The RESOURCESID must be an integer.

# !! Attention: You must use FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name).
# HOSTNAME rod.cs.utk.edu

# NFUCFGFILE define the NFU configuration file name.
 NFUCFGFILE  @prefix@/etc/nfu.cfg

# THREADS define the number of the statically allocated threads in 
# mutli-thread ibp server
 THREADS   4 

# MAXTHREADS define the max number of the  threads in 
# mutli-thread ibp server

# CL_IPv4 and CL_IPv6 define the client ip address which can allocate space on 
# ibp server.
# It's important to notice that if any CL_IPv4 or CL_IPv6 client are specified, 
# they are the only clients allowed to allocate space on ibp server; If no 
# client is specified, then all clients have allocate permission.
# CL_IPv4  160.36.57.212 255.255.255.255
