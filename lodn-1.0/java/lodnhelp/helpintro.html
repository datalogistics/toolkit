<h2><a name="LoDN"></a>LoDN</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Logistical Distribution Network (LoDN) is 
  an experimental content distribution tool for the academic community. The LoDN 
  Download Client is an application that allows users to access data stored in 
  the Logistical Network without installing or learning to use any complicated 
  software. LoDN uses the Logistical Networking infrastructure provided by the 
  Internet Backplane Protocol (IBP) and the Logistical Backbone (L-Bone) to store 
  file content on IBP storage &quot;depots&quot; registered with the L-Bone directory. 
  Content distributors can make LoDN data files available by including an active 
  link on a webpage, in an email, or through a content directory. Users access 
  these files by clicking an active link, thereby starting the LoDN Download Client, 
  and then use the client to retrieve the file content directly from IBP storage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Further information about IBP and the L-Bone can 
  be found at http://loci.cs.utk.edu/ibp/ and http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lbone/ .

<h2><a name="LN"></a>Logistical Networking</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;working&quot; storage offered by Logistical 
  Networking differs from other network storage schemes because it follows the 
  same scalable design paradigm as the Internet; meaning that it is based on a 
  layered approach in which a highly generic, best effort service provides the 
  foundation on which all higher-level services are built. The foundational service 
  underpinning Logistical Networking is IBP, a best-effort service for managing 
  allocations on storage &quot;depots.&quot; In order to maximize scalability 
  and sharability, IBP storage allocations are time-limited by default. All stronger 
  services, such as extended storage duration, reliability, and fault tolerance, 
  are provided &quot;end-to-end&quot; by layers of middleware implemented on top 
  of IBP. Using this scalable approach, Logistical Networking has been able to 
  create a testbed that offers unbrokered access via the Internet to 36+ terabytes 
  of storage space, on over 325 locally maintained IBP storage depots spread across 
  the US and 21 other countries around the world. The L-Bone is a directory and 
  resource discovery service cataloguing these IBP storage depots; clients may 
  query the L-Bone for depots with specific characteristics, including minimum 
  storage capacity, duration policy, proximity, etc. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The storage infrastructure used by LoDN is supported 
  by the NSF-CISE Research Infrastructure program, under grant EIA-9972889, and 
  Research Resources program, under grant EIA-0224441. </font></p>
