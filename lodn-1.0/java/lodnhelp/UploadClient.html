<h2><a name="PublisherWindow"></a>Using the Publisher Window:</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Use the LoDN Upload Client to upload the contents 
  of a file from your local system into storage and automatically create an exNode 
  in your current LoDN directory. In the Publisher window (Fig. 1), enter the 
  name of the file to be uploaded in the box labeled &quot;Input File&quot; or 
  click <i>Browse</i> to choose a file to upload. Adjust upload parameters (see 
  below) and then click <i>Upload</i>. The Transfer Progress window will appear, 
  showing the status of the upload. When the upload is complete, click OK to close 
  the Transfer Progress window. (Note: If the new exNode does not immediately 
  appear in your exNode directory list, use your browser's refresh command to 
  reload the page.)</font></p>

<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Input File</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Enter the name of the file you wish to upload 
  in the box provided, or click <i>Browse</i> to choose a file to upload.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Output File</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Specifies the LoDN directory location where your 
  exNode will be placed. When you upload a file, the upload client will create 
  an exNode, a pointer to the stored content. The exNode is named by appending 
  the <font face="Courier New" >.xnd</font> extension to the name of 
  the uploaded file. A copy of the exNode will be stored in the current LoDN directory, 
  where it will be automatically maintained by LoDN's exNode &quot;warmer&quot;. 
  (More information about exNodes and warming is available from the LoDN help 
  pages, accessed by clicking &quot;Help&quot; from your LoDN home area.)</font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="LocationandConnectionType"></a>Location 
  and Connection Type:</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Location Type and Code</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;Location&quot; box allows you to request 
  that your data be stored near a specific geographical location. LoDN will place 
  your data in available storage as near as possible to your specified location. 
  If the data is to be downloaded from a remote location, consider storing the 
  data near the download site. For content that will be broadly or globally distributed, 
  you may upload content and then create copies of the content at multiple geographically 
  locations using the &quot;Augment&quot; function (accessible in your LoDN home 
  area).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">To specify a geographical location, use the drop 
  down menu to select a location type: &quot;zip&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, &quot;country&quot;, 
  or &quot;airport&quot;. Then use the box labeled &quot;Location Code&quot; to 
  enter the appropriate location code: a five digit zip code (US only), two letter 
  state abbreviation (US only), three letter airport code, or two letter ISO country 
  code. LoDN will store your content as near as possible to your specified location 
  (dependent upon storage availability in the specified area). </font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Connection Type</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Use the radio buttons to choose the type of connection 
  you are using to access the Internet. Default values of &quot;Number of Connections&quot; 
  and &quot;Block Size&quot; will be adjusted according to your connection type. 
  </font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="AdvancedParameters"></a>Advanced Parameters:</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Number of Connections</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Number of connections&quot; refers to the 
  maximum number of data transfer operations to be performed concurrently during 
  upload. Each connection, or &quot;thread,&quot; is an individual transfer (i.e. 
  TCP) stream, delivering a separate block of data. Maximizing upload performance 
  is a matter of balancing the number of connection threads with available resources 
  (local memory, bandwidth, etc.). Using more connection threads usually means 
  faster performance, provided that sufficient bandwidth and memory (on your local 
  system) is available to the upload client. For transfers over public wide area 
  networks, use one to three threads for TCP friendliness. For transfers over 
  high-speed links (e.g., Abilene, ESNet, etc.), or dedicated links between research 
  facilities, try using ten or more threads for maximum performance. See Figure 
  2 for further suggestions. To specify the number of connections, you may choose 
  a number from the drop down menu, or overwrite the menu box with a positive 
  integer. </font></p>

<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Block Size</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the IBP storage depots used by LoDN offer 
  a best effort service, LoDN relies on the combined use of replication, fragmentation, 
  and striping of fragments across multiple depots to strengthen assurance of 
  sustained data accessibility. As on the hard drive of a computer, a file stored 
  with IBP may be fragmented into many blocks of data, with each data block stored 
  in a separate location. The fragments may be spread across several IBP depots, 
  or stored in separate allocations within the same depot. A file may be left 
  whole (one fragment) or split into many smaller data blocks. With LoDN, fragmenting 
  the file into data blocks is controlled by specifying a block size. &quot;Block 
  Size&quot; indicates the size of the data blocks into which your data will be 
  divided. The number of fragments into which a file is partitioned will equal 
  the total file size divided by the specified block size. If you choose a block 
  size larger than the file size, the file will not be fragmented. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Enter a positive integer in the box labeled &quot;Block 
  Size,&quot; then use the radio buttons to choose units of kilobytes (KB) or 
  megabytes (MB). Choose a block size small enough to cause sufficient fragmentation 
  for fault tolerance considerations, but large enough to allow good upload performance. 
  Larger block size allows faster uploads by decreasing the number of allocation 
  operations necessary to store the file content, but the effect is asymptotic. 
  A block size between 512 KB and 2 MB is optimal for most routine applications. 
  </font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Number of Copies</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Copies&quot; specifies the number of replicas 
  of your content that should be stored. Storing multiple copies guards against 
  inaccessibility due to a network outage or data loss if one storage allocation 
  fails. However, the value of each additional replica is balanced by the storage 
  capacity needed to house it. Please remember that the storage resources employed 
  by LoDN, although plentiful, are shared resources. Two to three copies provides 
  sufficient backup in most instances. Use the drop-down menu labeled &quot;Copies&quot; 
  to select a value. </font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman">Number of Depots</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As mentioned above, since the IBP storage depots 
  used by LoDN offer a best effort service, LoDN relies on the combined use of 
  replication, fragmentation, and striping of fragments across multiple depots 
  to strengthen assurance of sustained data accessibility. When a file is uploaded, 
  the file content is divided into blocks of data. Those data blocks are replicated 
  and then distributed over several IBP depots for storage. Using multiple storage 
  locations to house data replicas provides greater fault tolerance in case one 
  storage depot fails. Using multiple depots will also improve download performance, 
  as the download client will maximize speed by retrieving data from the fastest 
  source depot. Choose the number of depots over which the data will be distributed 
  to ensure a reasonable level of fault tolerance and download performance for 
  the number of data blocks to be stored. A value of five depots is optimal in 
  most instances. </font></p>
