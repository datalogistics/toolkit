  interface for Windows. However, the download client interface for Mac or Unix 
  operating systems are substantially identical to the version pictured.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The box labeled &quot;Input File&quot; will already 
  be filled in with the content key for the file to be downloaded. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Enter a file path in the box labeled &quot;Output 
  File,&quot; or click <i>Browse</i> to choose a location and file name for the 
  downloaded content.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After selecting desired values for the download 
  parameters, click either the <i>Download</i> or <i>Execute</i> button to begin 
  downloading. <i>Download</i> simply retrieves the file, while <i>Execute</i> 
  retrieves the file and then automatically opens the downloaded file. Use the 
  <i>Execute</i> button only when you trust the file content, as <i>Execute</i> 
  does not differentiate between legitimate file content and harmful content such 
  as a virus. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When the download begins, the &quot;Transfer Progress&quot; 
  window (<a href="#Figure1">Fig. 3</a>) will appear and display the status of 
  the download. When the download is complete, click <i>OK</i> to close the Transfer 
  Progress window. To exit LoDN, close the download client window. <br>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="DownloadParameters"></a>Download Parameters</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="Connections"></a>Number of Connections</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Number of connections&quot; refers to the 
  maximum number of data transfer operations to be performed concurrently during 
  download. Each connection, or &quot;thread,&quot; is an individual transfer 
  stream, retrieving a separate block of data. Maximizing download performance 
  is a matter of balancing the number of connection threads with available bandwidth. 
  Using more connection threads usually means faster performance, provided that 
  sufficient bandwidth is available. For transfers within a local area network, 
  four to six threads are recommended. For transfers over public wide area networks, 
  use one to two threads for TCP friendliness. For transfers over dedicated high-speed 
  links, as between research facilities, try using ten or more threads for maximum 
  performance. See <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a> for further suggestions. You 
  may choose a number from the drop down menu, or overwrite the menu box with 
  a positive integer. </font></p>
<h3><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="BlockSize"></a>Transfer Block Size</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">During download, each connection thread retrieves 
  one incremental block of data at a time; the &quot;transfer block size&quot; 
  indicates a preferred size for this download increment. Choose a small block 
  size for retrieving small files or downloading over a slower connection, and 
  a large block size for larger files or faster connections. See <a href="#Figure2">Figure 
  2</a> for suggested settings. When downloading small files (a few hundred KB 
  or less) over a slow connection you may have best results choosing a block size 
  on the order of the filesize. If you are unsure of the file size or your connection 
  speed, try a transfer block size of 512 KB. Choose a transfer block size by 
  entering a positive integer in the box provided and using the radio buttons 
  to select units of kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB). </font></p>

  <font size="-1">Note: Mbps is megabits per second. To convert to MBps (megabytes 
  per second), divide Mbps by 8.</font></font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="DownloadvsExecute"></a>Download versus 
  Execute</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After selecting desired values for the download 
  parameters, click either the <i>Download</i> or <i>Execute</i> button to begin 
  downloading. <i>Download</i> simply retrieves the file, while <i>Execute</i> 
  retrieves the file and then automatically opens the downloaded file or runs 
  the downloaded application. Use the <i>Execute</i> button only when you trust 
  the file content, as <i>Execute</i> does not differentiate between legitimate 
  file content and harmful content such as a virus. </font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="TransferProgressWindow"></a>Transfer 
  Progress Window</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When the download begins, the &quot;Transfer Progress&quot; 
  window (Fig. 3) will appear and display the status of the download. When the 
  download is complete, click <i>OK</i> to close the Transfer Progress window. 
  To exit LoDN, close the download client window. <br>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="MenuBarCommands"></a>Menu Bar Commands</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">From the menu bar at the top left of the download 
  client window (<a href="#Figure1">Fig. 1</a>) you may access the &quot;File&quot; 
  and &quot;Help&quot; menus. Options for these menus are listed below:</font></p>
<p>The &quot;File-&gt;Open&quot; command allows you to browse for an input file. 
  This option is only available when using the download client in stand-alone 
  mode.</p>
<p>The &quot;File-&gt;Download&quot; command is equivalent to clicking the <i>Download</i> 
  button, located at the bottom of the client window. The <i>Download</i> command 
  starts the file transfer. </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;File-&gt;Exit&quot; closes the Download 
  Client window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Help-&gt;Contents&quot; opens the browsable
