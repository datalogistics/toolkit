<h1>Fault Tolerance in LoDN</h1>
<p>The following information about how LoDN maintains stored data should aid you 
  in implementing replication and geographical distribution in order to provide 
  acceptable levels of fault tolerance for your data. But remember, LoDN uses 
  &quot;soft storage.&quot; Data stored with LoDN may be lost due to network disruption, 
  machine outage, or the attrition of individual stored data blocks. While higher 
  levels of replication can provide greater stability, there are no guarantees 
  and no backups. </p>
<h2>Soft Storage</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The foundational service underpinning logistical 
  networking and LoDN is IBP (<a href="/redirect?http://loci.cs.utk.edu/ibp/">http://loci.cs.utk.edu/ibp/</a>), 
  a best-effort service for managing allocations on storage &quot;depots.&quot; 
  IBP is designed to provide a globally scalable and sharable storage platform, 
  composed of privately maintained storage depots around the world. IBP masks 
  the underlying differences between systems and storage types (disk or ram), 
  and provides uniform access to all depots via the network. To offer maximum 
  scalability, IBP storage allocations are lightweight and best effort; and for 
  maximum sharability, they are also time-limited. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">IBP depots offer two types of storage allocations, 
  soft or hard. Soft storage allocations are made using free space in the local 
  file system&#151;space that may be reclaimed at any time according to the needs 
  of the local system. Hard storage allocations are made using dedicated IBP storage 
  space that will not be reclaimed by the local system. Hard storage is highly 
  stable and offers stronger guarantees that your stored data will remain intact 
  and accessible for a specified duration. Soft storage makes weaker guarantees, 
  but is offered by IBP depots in great abundance. And, accessibility of both 
  soft and hard storage allocations are vulnerable to machine and network outages. 
  At the moment, LoDN utilizes only soft storage allocations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Because LoDN uses best effort, time-limited storage, 
  all stronger services (reliability, fault tolerance, extended storage duration, 
  large file size) are provided &quot;end-to-end&quot; by layers of middleware 
  implemented on top of IBP. For example, an exNode metadata file enables aggregation 
  of multiple weak storage allocations in order to achieve strong service characteristics 
  not offered by any single allocation; the exNode keeps track of the metadata 
  necessary to manage distributed content.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman">Exnode Warming</font><font face="Times New Roman"> 
  </font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">LoDN uses time-limited storage, so, in order to 
  maintain file content in storage for longer than the length of an allocation's 
  time limit, each allocation's lease must be periodically renewed. And, since 
  data blocks held in soft storage may become temporarily or permanently unavailable, 
  data replicas must be actively maintained, with new replicas being created as 
  others decay. An exNode &quot;warmer&quot; is used to take the burden of exNode 
  maintenance off the user. When you place an exNode in your LoDN directory (by 
  uploading a file or importing an exNode), LoDN's warmer automatically renews 
  the storage leases for you. The exNode warmer also maintains fault tolerance 
  by checking that the specified number of copies of each data block are accessible, 
  and automatically creating new replicas when necessary. ExNodes that are not 
  warmed will deteriorate over time, as allocations holding blocks of the stored 
  content expire and the data is erased from those expired allocations, or as 
  blocks decay and become inaccessible. If you wish to keep stored content available 
  for an extended period (i.e., longer than a day or two), it is recommended that 
  you place the exNode in your LoDN directory where it will be actively maintained. 
  </font></p>
<h2>Using Replication and Distribution</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">LoDN facilitates the combined use of replication, 
  fragmentation, and striping of file fragments across multiple depots to provide 
  fault tolerance and sustained data accessibility. When a file is uploaded, the 
  file content is divided into blocks of data, which are replicated and then distributed 
  over several IBP depots for storage. Scattering the fragmented replicas of file 
  content over multiple storage locations helps to ensure that stored content 
  will remain accessible in case of a machine or network outage, or the attrition 
  of individual soft storage blocks. </font></p>
<h4><font face="Times New Roman">Block Size</font></h4>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As on the hard drive of a computer, a file stored 
  with IBP may be fragmented into many blocks of data, with each data block stored 
  in a separate location. The fragments may be spread across several IBP depots, 
  or stored in separate allocations within the same depot. A small file may be 
  left whole (one fragment), while larger files can be partitioned into many smaller 
  data blocks. With LoDN, fragmenting the file into data blocks is controlled 
  by specifying a block size. &quot;Block Size&quot; indicates the size of the 
  data blocks into which your file will be divided. The number of fragments into 
  which a file is partitioned will equal the total file size divided by the specified 
  block size. If you choose a block size larger than the file size, the file will 
  not be fragmented. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Choose a block size small enough to cause sufficient 
  fragmentation for fault tolerance considerations, but large enough to allow 
  good upload performance. Larger block size allows faster uploads of large data 
  sets by decreasing the number of allocation operations necessary to store the 
  file content, but the effect is asymptotic. A block size between 512 KB and 
  2 MB is optimal for most routine applications. </font></p>
<h4><font face="Times New Roman">Number of Copies</font></h4>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">LoDN allows you to specify</font><font face="Times New Roman"> 
  the number of replicas of your file content that should be stored. Storing multiple 
  copies guards against inaccessibility due to a network outage or data loss. 
  However, the value of each additional replica is balanced by the storage capacity 
  needed to house it. Please remember that the storage resources employed by LoDN 
  are shared resources. Two to three copies provides sufficient backup in most 
  instances.</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<h4><font face="Times New Roman">Number of Depots</font></h4>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Storing replicas of data blocks on multiple depots 
  helps to prevent inaccessibility or data loss if one depot fails. Using multiple 
  depots will also improve download performance, as the download client will maximize 
  speed by retrieving data from the fastest source depot. Although LoDN does not 
  provide explicit control over where individual data blocks are stored (the user 
  specifies a general geographical location and number of depots for the entire 
  file), a desirable striping and redundancy pattern may be achieved by distributing 
  multiple copies of fragmented data across several depots. A value of five depots 
  is optimal in most instances. </font></p>
