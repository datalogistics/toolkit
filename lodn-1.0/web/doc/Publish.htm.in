   <br>
   <h2>Logging In</h2><br>
   
    <p><font>From the LoDN welcome page 
    (<a href="@LODN_URL@" target="_blank">@LODN_URL@</a>)
    you can sign up for a new LoDN account, log in to an existing account, or browse
    LoDN's public directory as a guest. Logging in to your own account takes you
    to your home area, where you can upload or download files and manage your stored
    content. Logging in as a guest allows you to access stored content that other
    LoDN users have made available to the public.</font></p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Browse as Guest</h2><br>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the LoDN welcome page, click the &quot;browse
    files as guest&quot; link to access LoDN's public directory. You do not need
    a LoDN account to browse as a guest. When browsing the public directory you
    can access published content made available by registered LoDN users. With LoDN,
    registered users have the option to &quot;publish&quot; an exNode (a pointer
    to stored content). Publishing an exNode makes a read-only version of the exNode
    publicly accessible. Guests can use the read-only exNode to download file content
    from the network without having access to any data management options&#151;i.e.
    guests cannot alter or delete published data.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The public directory interface, like the interface
    for registered users, is based on an IMAP email interface, so the look and feel
    of the page should be familiar to most users. On the public directory page,
    you will find the current directory path displayed near the top of the left-hand
    frame; below this is a directory list that allows you to navigate the publicly
    accessible LoDN subdirectories. </font></p><br>
    
    <ul>
    <li><font>To <b>open a subdirectory</b>, click the directory
    name or folder icon. When you open a subdirectory, the exNode list (in the
    main frame of the page) will display the published exNodes in that folder.
    <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
    <li><font>To<b> move up one directory level</b>, click
    &quot;<b><u>..</u></b>&quot;. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font>From the exNode list in the main frame of the
    page, you may download file content, view an exNode file, or get a read-only
    exNode file.</font></p>
    <ul>
    <li><font>To <b>download file content</b>, click the
    exNode name for the file you wish to download; this will start the LoDN Java
    Download Client. Use the download client window to select a location and filename
    for the output file and indicate your connection speed, then click <i>Download</i>.
    (For more information about using the Download Client, see <a href="DownloadClient.htm" target="_blank">Download
    Client Help</a>, also accessible from the download client window under Help&#150;&gt;Contents.)<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>				
    <li><font>To <b>download multiple files</b>, use the
    check boxes to select one or more exNodes from the list, then choose &quot;Download&quot;
    from the Operations drop-down menu and click <i>Go</i>. The LoDN download
    client window will appear. Use the download client window to select your connection
    speed, then click <i>Download</i>. The selected files will be downloaded in
    succession and placed in the local directory specified in the &quot;Output
    File&quot; field.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
    <li><font>To <b>view an exNode file</b> (display a list
    of the storage allocations referenced by that exNode), click the &quot; <img src="button_view.gif" width="14" height="13">
    &quot; icon to the right of the exNode name. Information found in the exNode
    file includes the allocation type, IP address and port number of storage depot,
    and expiration date and time for each data block. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
    <li><font>To <b>get a read-only exNode file</b>, click
    the &quot;<img src="button_exro.gif" width="13" height="12"> &quot; icon.
    For more information about read-only exNodes, see the &quot;Read-Only vs.
    Full Capability ExNodes&quot; section below. </font></li>
    </ul>

    <p><font><b>Note:</b> While browsing as a guest you have
    access to read-only versions of published exNodes. However, you cannot perform
    data management operations (augment, delete, publish/unpublish) on stored content
    using a read-only exNode. If you wish to maintain your own copy of a published
    file, download the file content from the public directory, then upload the content
    using the LoDN upload client to produce an exNode with full (not just read-only)
    capabilities. Do not import a read-only exNode into your LoDN directory, as
    the exNode warmer (see &quot;ExNodes and Warming&quot;) will not be able to
    maintain the stored content using a read-only exNode. </font></p><br><br>
											
    <h2>Your Home Area</h2><br>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The directory interface to your LoDN home area
    is based on the interface used for accessing IMAP email accounts, so the look
    and feel of your home area will most likely be familiar. Log in to your home
    area from LoDN's welcome page at <a href="@LODN_URL@" target="_blank">@LODN_URL@</a>.
    From your home area, you can upload and download content to and from network
    storage, and manage your stored content. </font></p><br><br>
    
    <h2>ExNodes and &quot;Warming&quot;</h2><br>
    <p><font> The logistical networking storage that LoDN uses
    is designed to be globally scalable and sharable. To offer maximum scalability,
    the storage allocations are lightweight and best effort; and for maximum sharability,
    they are also time-limited. Using best effort, time-limited storage means that
    reliability, fault tolerance, and extended storage duration are implemented
    by aggregating multiple weak storage allocations to achieve strong service characteristics
    not offered by any single allocation. The exNode is a metadata filetype that
    accommodates the aggregation of individual storage allocations into a &quot;network
    file&quot; by holding the metadata necessary to manage distributed content.
    For more info about logistical networking and LoDN, click <a href="Intro.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</font></p><br>
		      
    <p><font>When a file is uploaded with LoDN, the file content
    is broken into small data blocks. Each data block is then replicated and the
    replicas are distributed across multiple remote storage locations (called storage
    &quot;depots&quot;) accessed via the network, with each data block placed in
    a separate allocation. Scattering fragmented replicas of file content over multiple
    storage locations helps to ensure that stored content will remain accessible
    in case of a machine or network outage. An exNode is used to keep track of each
    block of stored data: where the block is stored, when its storage &quot;lease&quot;
    expires, etc. In essence, the exNode is a pointer to stored file content. The
    exNode acts like a pointer to file content stored over the network, in the same
    way that the UNIX inode is a pointer to storage allocations on a hard drive.</font></p><br>
    
    <p><font>LoDN uses time-limited storage, so, in order to
    maintain file content in storage for longer than the length of an allocation's
    time limit, each allocation's lease must be periodically renewed. An exNode
    &quot;warmer&quot; is used to take the burden of exNode maintenance off the
    user. When you place an exNode in your LoDN directory (by uploading a file or
    importing an exNode), LoDN's warmer automatically renews the storage leases
    for you, and makes sure that enough copies of each data block are available
    to provide acceptable fault-tolerance. The warmer operates on all exNodes in
    your LoDN directory, whether they are &quot;published&quot; (made available
    for download by other LoDN users or guests) or &quot;unpublished&quot; (accessible
    only by you). ExNodes that are not warmed will deteriorate over time, as allocations
    holding blocks of the stored content expire and the data is erased from those
    expired allocations. If you wish to keep stored content available for an extended
    period (i.e., longer than a day or two), it is recommended that you place the
    exNode in your LoDN directory. </font></p><br>
    
    <p><font>Users can control how their exnodes are warmed and augmented. By 
    clicking the augment button a window pops up allowing the user to create,
    modify and delete sites for exnodes and directories.  Each site is a 
    collection of depots that the warmer can use. The warmer tries to keep one 
    complete copy of the data per site (a minimum of three sites with depots 
    should be specified for the exnode to have good status). The warmer uses the 
    closest hierarchical specification to the exnode meaning it examines if 
    there is a specification for the exnode, then the directory containing the 
    exnode, then the next higher directory.  It continues to look for a 
    specification until it finds one or the root of the content directory is reached. 
    </font></p><br><br>
							  
    <h2>LoDN Directories</h2><br>
    <p><fontIn your home area, the directory list at the left
    of the page allows you to navigate within your LoDN folders. The current directory
    path is given near the top of the left-hand frame. Just below this, folders
    within the current directory are shown. ExNodes within the current directory
    are listed to the right, in the main portion of the page. </font></p><br>
    <ul>
    <li><font>To <b>open a directory</b>, click the directory
    name to the right of the folder icon. When you open a directory, the exNode
    list (in the main frame of the page) will display the exNodes in that folder.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    </font></li>
    <li><font>To <b>move up one directory level</b>, click
    &quot;<u><b>..</b></u>&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
    <li><font>To <b>create a new subdirectory</b> within
    the current directory, enter a folder name in the &quot;Create Directory&quot;
    box, and then click <i>Create</i>.<br>
    </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font><b>Note:</b> Placing an exNode in a LoDN directory
    means that it is maintained or &quot;warmed&quot; automatically by the LoDN
    server. ExNodes that are not warmed will deteriorate over time. </font></p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Uploading Data and ExNodes</h2><br>
    <p><font>From your home area there are two options for
    placing an exNode in your LoDN directory: uploading the contents of a file or
    importing an already existing exNode into the LoDN directory.</font></p>
    <ul>
    <li><font>To <b>import an exNode</b> created using the
    LoRS Tools, received via e-mail, etc., from your local system to your current
    LoDN directory: Enter a filepath in the box labeled &quot;Upload ExNode,&quot;
    or click <i>Browse</i> and select a <font face="Courier New">.xnd</font> file
    to upload, then click <i>Upload</i>. <b>Note:</b> The LoDN exNode warmer will
    maintain exNodes in your LoDN directory (see &quot;ExNodes and Warming&quot;
    above), but the warmer cannot replace lost data from allocations that have
    already expired. Before importing, you may wish to use the LoRS Tools software
    (<a href="http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lors/" target="_self">http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lors/</a>)
    to &quot;List&quot; the exNode and confirm that at least one complete replica
    of the content is available, especially if the exNode has been out of a warmer
    for a day or more. </font><br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><font>To <b>upload the contents of a file</b> from
    your local system into storage and automatically create an exNode in your
    current LoDN directory: <br>
    Click the &quot;<i>Launch Java Upload Client</i>&quot; button to start the
    LoDN Publisher Java Upload client. In the publisher window (Fig. 1), enter
    the name of the file to be uploaded in the box labeled &quot;Input File&quot;
    or click <i>Browse</i> to choose a file to upload. Adjust upload parameters
    (see below) and then click <i>Upload</i>. The &quot;Transfer Progress&quot;
    window will appear, showing the status of the upload. When the upload is complete,
    click OK to close the Transfer Progress window. If the new exNode does not
    immediately appear in your exNode directory list, use your browser's refresh
    command to reload the page.</font></li>
    </ul><br>
    
    <p><font><b>Note:</b> Placing an exNode in a LoDN directory
    does not automatically give others access to that exNode. An exNode in your
    directory is private until you<i> Publish</i> it (see below).</font></P><br><br>
    
    <b><font>LoDN Publisher Java Upload Client</font></b><br><br>
    <p><font>Information in this section can also be accessed
    from the LoDN Publisher window, under Help&#150;&gt;Contents. </font></p>
    <p><font><b>Figure 1: </b>The LoDN Upload Client</font><br>
    <img src="PublishFig1.jpg" width="414" height="387"></p><br>
    
    <b><i><font>Input File</font></b></i><br>
    <p><font>Enter the name of the file you wish to upload
    in the box provided, or click <i>Browse</i> to choose a file to upload.</font></p><br>
    
    <b><i><font>Output File</font></b></i><br>
    <p><font>Specifies the LoDN directory location where your
    exNode will be placed. When you upload a file, the upload client will create
    an exNode (a pointer to the stored content). The exNode is named by appending
    the <font face="Courier New" >.xnd</font> extension to the name of the uploaded
    file. A copy of the exNode will be stored in the current LoDN directory, where
    it will be automatically maintained by LoDN's exNode &quot;warmer&quot;. </font></p><br>
    <b><i><font>Location
    and Connection Type:</font></b></i><br><br>
    <b><i><font>Location Type and Code</font></b></i><br>
    <p><font>The &quot;Location Type&quot; and &quot;Location
    Code&quot; boxes allows you to request that your data be stored near a specific
    geographical location. LoDN will place your data in available storage as near	
    as possible to your specified location. If the data is to be downloaded from
    a remote location, consider storing the data near the download site. For content
    that will be broadly or globally distributed, you may upload content and then
    create copies of the content at multiple geographical locations using the &quot;Augment&quot;
    function (accessible in your LoDN home area).</font></p><br>
    <p><font>To specify a geographical location, use the drop
    down menu to select a location type: &quot;zip&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, &quot;country&quot;,
    or &quot;airport&quot;. Then use the box labeled &quot;Location Code&quot; to
    enter the appropriate location code: a five digit zip code (US only), two letter
    state abbreviation (US only), three letter airport code, or two letter ISO country
    code. LoDN will store your content as near as possible to your specified location
    (dependent upon storage availability in the specified area). </font></p><br>
    <b><i><font>Connection Type</font></b></i><br>
    <p><font>Use the radio buttons to choose the type of connection
    you are using to access the Internet. Default values of &quot;Number of Connections&quot;
    and &quot;Block Size&quot; will be adjusted according to your connection type.
    </font></p><br>	
    <b><i><font>Advanced Parameters:</font></b></i><br><br>
    <b><i><font>Number of Connections</font></b></i><br>
    <p><font>&quot;Number of connections&quot; refers to the
     maximum number of data transfer operations to be performed concurrently during
    upload. Each connection, or &quot;thread,&quot; is an individual transfer (i.e.
    TCP) stream, delivering a separate block of data. Maximizing upload performance	
    is a matter of balancing the number of connection threads with available resources
    (local memory, bandwidth, etc.). Using more connection threads usually means
    faster performance, provided that sufficient bandwidth and memory (on your local
    system) is available to the upload client. For transfers over public wide area
    networks, use one to three threads for TCP friendliness. For transfers over
    high-speed links (e.g., Abilene, ESNet, etc.), or dedicated links between research
    facilities, try using ten or more threads for maximum performance. See Figure
    2 for further suggestions. To specify the number of connections, you may choose
    integer. </font></p><br>
    <p><font><b>Figure 2:</b> Recommended Connection Settings</font><br>
    <img src="PublishFig2.gif" width="235" height="117"> </p><br>
    <b><i><font>Block Size</font></b></i><br>
    <p><font>Since the IBP storage depots used by LoDN offer
    a best effort service, LoDN relies on the combined use of replication, fragmentation,
    and striping of file fragments across multiple depots to strengthen assurance
    of sustained data accessibility. As on the hard drive of a computer, a file
    stored with IBP may be fragmented into many blocks of data, with each data block
    stored in a separate location. The fragments may be spread across several IBP
    depots, or stored in separate allocations within the same depot. A small file
    may be left whole (one fragment), while larger files can be split into many
    smaller data blocks. With LoDN, fragmenting the file into data blocks is controlled
    by specifying a block size. &quot;Block Size&quot; indicates the size of the
    data blocks into which your data will be divided. The number of fragments into
    which a file is partitioned will equal the total file size divided by the specified
    block size. If you choose a block size larger than the file size, the file will
    not be fragmented. </font></p><br>
    <p><font>Enter a positive integer in the box labeled &quot;Block
    Size,&quot; then use the radio buttons to choose units of kilobytes (KB) or
    megabytes (MB). Choose a block size small enough to cause sufficient fragmentation
    for fault tolerance considerations, but large enough to allow good upload performance.
    Larger block size allows faster uploads of large data sets by decreasing the
    number of allocation operations necessary to store the file content, but the
    effect is asymptotic. A block size between 512 KB and 2 MB is optimal for most
    routine applications. </font></p><br>
    <b><i><font>Number of Copies</font></b></i><br>
    <p><font>&quot;Copies&quot; specifies the number of replicas
    of your content that should be stored. Storing multiple copies guards against
    inaccessibility due to a network outage or data loss if one storage allocation
    fails. However, the value of each additional replica is balanced by the storage
    capacity needed to house it. Please remember that the storage resources employed
    by LoDN are shared resources. Two to three copies provides sufficient backup
    in most instances. Use the drop-down menu labeled &quot;Copies&quot; to select
    a value. </font></p><br>
    
    <b><i><font>Number of Depots</font></b></i><br>
    <p><font>As mentioned above, since the IBP storage depots
    used by LoDN offer a best effort service, LoDN relies on the combined use of
    replication, fragmentation, and striping of file fragments across multiple depots
    to strengthen assurance of sustained data accessibility. When a file is uploaded,
    the file content is divided into blocks of data. Those data blocks are replicated
    and then distributed over several IBP depots for storage. Using multiple storage
    depots to house data replicas provides greater fault tolerance in case one depot
    fails. Using multiple depots will also improve download performance, as the
    download client will maximize speed by retrieving data from the fastest source
    depot. Choose the number of depots over which the data will be distributed to
    ensure a reasonable level of fault tolerance and download performance for the
    number of data blocks to be stored. A value of five depots is optimal in most
    instances. </font></p><br><br>
    
    <b><font>LoRS Upload</font></b><br><br>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" >For more fine-grained control over uploading
    file content or adding replicas of stored content, consider using the Logistical
    Runtime System Tools (LoRS Tools) software. If you wish, you may use LoRS to
    upload file content to storage and generate an exNode, and then use LoDN's web
    interface to import the exNode into your LoDN directory. The LoRS software is
    engineered for high-performance, multi-threaded downloads and is available for
    all major OS platforms. The LoRS Tools software is available for free download
    from <a href="http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lors/downloads/" target="_self">http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lors/downloads/</a>
    . Downloading and installing the LoRS Tools takes only a few minutes. For more
    information about installing and using the LoRS Tools software, please refer
    to the LoRS user manual, available at
    <a href="http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lors/distributions/LoRS_Manual_v0_82.pdf/" target="_blank">http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lors/distributions/LoRS_Manual_v0_82.pdf/</a>.</font></p><br>
    <p><font><b>Note:</b> If you use LoRS to upload file content
    it is recommended that you import the exNode into LoDN as soon as possible to
    avoid data loss and take advantage of LoDN's exNode warmer (see &quot;ExNodes
    and Warming&quot; section above). </font></p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Managing ExNodes</h2><br>
    <b><font>The exNode List</font></b><br><br>
    <p><font>In your home area, a list of the exNodes within
    the current directory is found in the main frame of the page. This exNode list
    behaves similarly to the familiar IMAP email interface&#151;you can select or
    deselect items in the list using the check boxes and then perform operations
    on the selected items using commands from the drop-down menus. Some commands
    are also available by clicking the icons to the right of each exNode name. </font></p><br>
    <b><font>Select Menu</font></b><br><br>
    <p><font>Use the <b>&quot;Select&quot; drop down menu</b>
    to select all items in exNode list, deselect all items, or reverse the currently
    selected and unselected items. </font></p><br>
    <b><font>Operation Menu</font></b><br><br>
    <p><font>Use the <b>&quot;Operation&quot; drop down menu
    </b>to perform a download, augment, delete, or publish/unpublish operation on
    one or more selected exNodes from the exNode list. If more than one exNode is
    selected, the chosen operation will act on each selected exNode sequentially.
    To select an exNode, check the box to the left of the exNode name. See Figure
    3 for a description of the exNode operations. </font></p><br>
    <b><font>Quick Commands</font></b><br><br>
    <p><font>Operations to be performed on only one exNode
    may be executed by clicking the quick command icons to the right of each exNode
    name. Clicking one of these icons is equivalent to selecting a single exNode
    and then choosing the corresponding operation from the operation drop-down menu.
    In addition to the operations available via the operation menu (download, augment,
    delete, and publish/unpublish), there is also a quick command icon for the view
    command. Figure 3 gives a description of each command. </font></p><br>

    <h2>Read Only vs. Full Capability ExNodes</h2>
    <br>
    <p><font>ExNodes are pointers to stored content, and are
    used to access and manage that content. Full exNodes include read, write, and
    manage capabilities that allow the user to perform the range of operations described
    in the &quot;ExNode Management&quot; section above. Read-only exNodes include
    only the read capability and allow the user to download the file content. Read-only
    exNodes are analogous to read-only files; users may access, but not alter content
    using a read-only exNode. </font></p><br>
    <p><font>When you use LoDN to publish file content, a read-only
    version of the exNode is posted in the public directory. This allows other users
    and guests to use the read-only exNode to download file content, without granting
    them access to manage or delete the stored content. Users logged on as guests
    have access to read-only versions of published exNodes, but do not have access
    to the full capability exNodes. </font></p><br>
    <p><font>You can access read-only and full capability versions
    of your exNodes from your home area. In the exNode list, clicking the &quot;<img src="button_exro.gif" width="13" height="12">
    &quot; icon downloads a read-only version of the exNode, while clicking the
    &quot;<img src="button_exrw.gif" width="13" height="12"> &quot; icon downloads
    the full capability exNode (these commands download the <font face="Courier New">.xnd</font>
    file, not the stored content). If you or your colleagues are LoRS Tools users,
    you might wish to send an exNode file via email, ftp, etc., to be downloaded
    using the LoRS Tools. (For more information about the LoRS Tools software, visit
    <a href="http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lors" target="_self">http://loci.cs.utk.edu/lors</a>).
    </font></p><br>

    <p><font>Remember that you cannot perform data management
    operations (augment, delete, publish/unpublish) on stored content using a read-only
    exNode. If you use a read-only exNode to access stored content and you wish
    to maintain your own copy of the content, use the read-only exNode to download
    the content, then use LoDN's upload client to store your own copy of the content
    and produce an exNode with full capabilities. </font></p><br>
    
    <p><font><b>Note:</b> Do not import a read-only exNode
    into your LoDN directory, as the exNode warmer (see &quot;ExNodes and Warming&quot;)
    will not be able to maintain the stored content using a read-only exNode.</font></p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Content Distribution</h2><br>
    
    <p><font>You can make LoDN data files available by placing
    an active &quot;LoDN link&quot; on a webpage, sending a LoDN link by email,
    or sharing published content via the LoDN directory. To get a LoDN link url
    for sharing your file content, go to your LoDN home area and right-click the	
    appropriate exNode name, choose <i>Copy Shortcut</i>, and paste the link where
    needed. You can copy and paste this link directly into a webpage, email, document,
    spreadsheet, etc., just as with any other url. Users access stored content by
    clicking a LoDN link, which starts the LoDN Download Client, and then use the
    download client to retrieve the content directly from network storage.</font>
    </p><br>
    
    <p><font>Keep in mind that if you are publishing content
    using a LoDN link, it will be helpful to your users if you include some descriptive
    information about the content (file size, file type, etc.) and some information
    about the LoDN Download client (that it requires Java Web Start, etc.). In order
    to use the LoDN Download client, a user must have Java Web Start installed on
    their computer. For Windows users, Java Web Start will be automatically detected
    and installed if necessary. Other users should manually install Java Web Start,
    which is included with the free download of the Java 2 Runtime Environment,
    Standard Edition (JRE) v1.4.2 (information and downloads are available at <a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_self">java.sun.com</a>).
    When starting the LoDN client for the first time, it may take a few seconds
    for the client files to be configured. A dialog box will appear, verifying that
    you wish to install and run the LoDN Download client. LoDN's security certificate
    is digitally signed by the University of Tennessee and the user must accept
    the certificate prior to running the application for the first time. </font></p><br>
