@section intro Introduction

    Welcome to the Logistical Runtime System (LoRS) C-API documentation.

    <br>Please take a look at the documentation while you are here. If you are
    interested in our work and you would like to test the tools, you may
    download them <a href="http://loci.cs.utk.edu/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownload&cid=4_7">here</a>.  If you have difficulty, please send mail 
    to <a href="mailto:lors@cs.utk.edu">lors@cs.utk.edu</a>.

    <br>If you find descriptions here confusing or incomplete 
    <b>by all means</b>
    let <a href="mailto:lors@cs.utk.edu">us know</a>.  Documentation, like
    software design, is a reflective cycle which grows not only from the
    direction of the developers but from the changing needs of the users.
    We are fully committed to the development and success of our software and 
    tools, and we are happy to help.
