LoRS Library and Command Line Tools.
========================

Build:

    The Lors-0.82 package should build on any moderately current Unix like
    environment.  Any uncommon packages (libxml2, popt, and zlib) are included
    with the distribution.  In addition to these, all other LoCI packages
    (libexnode, lbone, and IBP) and their dependencies are included for your 
    convenience.

    The general procedure for compilation and installation follow these four
    steps.

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
        (depending on your platform, configure may take up to 20 minutes.)
        make 
        make install
        (Add your install directory to your PATH 
         and setup LD_LIBRARY_PATH if necessary.)
        sh ./lors_setup.sh

    You may specify an installation prefix using the --prefix=<dir>
    switch to 'configure', where "<dir>" is the full path to the
    destination directory.  The default value is:

        /<LoRS source package root>/local/ 

    If you do not wish to have the included packages built because they are
    already on your system, you should be able to specify the location; 
    see ./configure --help for the available options.

    After configure completes successfully, run 'make' followed by 'make
    install'

    After this has successfully completed, we recommend you run the
    'lors_setup.sh' script to setup the "~/.xndrc" config file for the LoRS
    Command line Tools.

    If the included libxml2 package was compiled and installed, you will 
    need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in order for your 
    command line tools to find this library.
    in CSH environment:

        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<installpath>/lib

    or in BASH/SH environment:

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<installpath>/lib


    Where "<installpath>" is replaced with the value given to --prefix

    In the event that this value is set improperly, when running the lors tools
    you will see an error similar to this:

        ld.so.1: /homes/user/local/bin/lors_ls: fatal: libxml2.so.2:
        open failed: No such file or directory
        Killed

Instructions for AIX:
    In AIX, you would set LIBPATH rather than LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the location
    of the dynamic libraries.
    Due to compiler differences it may be necessary to change the predefined
    Makefiles in libe2e/des and libe2e/md5 to compile proplerly.
        Remove -fomit-frame-pointer, and change 'gcc' to your system's
        compiler.

    Before running configure set the following environment variables:
        CFLAGS="-w"
        CC=lxc          # or your compiler of choice.

Run:

    Example commands.

        lors_upload filename -f -F 8 -c 2 -l "st= TN" 
        lors_ls filename.xnd
        lors_download filename.xnd -o filename2

        diff filename filename2
