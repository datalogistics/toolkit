What's new for the version of IBP 1.1.1
###################################################

In version 1.1.1, there are some new features introduced.

1. Real volatile allocation
  Since IBP uses some resources (disk) shared with other applications, IBP server periodly monitors the free resource and guarantees that there are enough resources left for the other applications. 

2. Grace period after server crash
  When the IBP depot recovers from crash, it gives the clients enough time to copy their allocation to another depot. At the same time, the depot will repay the client for the time due to crash.

3. Allocation recovery after server restart
  Some new mechanism is used in the new code to guarantee that the capabilities can be recovered to its former state before server stopped.
 
4. The option to not recover the old capabilities
