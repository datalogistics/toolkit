Requirements:

    Perl          5.6.0 w/ ExtUtils::Embed

  CGI -- 
    IBPClientLib  http://loci.cs.utk.edu/ibp/downloads v1.1.1 
    ECGI    --    http://global-owl.de/ecgi/download/   v0.6.2
    OpenLDAP -    http://openldap.org                   v2.0.18

        compile and install the ecgi package. specify the root of the ecgi
        installation in makefile.inc

  CLIENT --
    IBPClientLib  http://loci.cs.utk.edu/ibp/downloads v1.1.1 
    NWS           http://nws.cs.ucsb.edu                nws-2.0.5   

        Unpack the above distributions in to the lbone root directory.
        name them, 'ibp', and 'nws' respecitively.  You do not need to 
        build them.  This will be done automatically.

  SERVER
    IBPClientLib  http://loci.cs.utk.edu/ibp/downloads v1.1.1 
    OpenLDAP -    http://openldap.org                   v2.0.18
        
        Specify the path of the root of your openldap installation in
        makefile.inc


LBONE SRC:
  After unpacking ibp and nws, your root directory structure should look like
  this: 
    cgi/             make_all.sh*  ibp/      README   
    client/  ldifs/  makefile.inc  nws/      server/

    'cgi', 'client' and 'server' represent the three parts of the lbone
    distribution.

  modify cgi/include/lbone_cgi_base.h to contain the proper address of your
    openldap server and port. This is important.

  modify makefile.inc to specify the root locations of the necessary
  directories. (ECGI and OpenLDap, and possibly perl).

  To build everything run ./make_all.sh


OPENLDAP configuration.
  SCHEMA:
    copy local.schema to the location of your schema directory. you may name
    the file whatever you wish, provided it is included through your
    slapd.conf file
 
  SLAPD.CONF
    It should look similar to the provided slapd.conf file. You
    may wish to change your rootpw to a more discrete value.  This is the
    same value you will put in cgi/include/lbone_cgi_base.h for the password.
    A mis-match will break only the cgi pages.

  BEGIN:
    once you have populated the database with information, you may start the
    ldap server.

    slapd -f slapd.conf -h ldap://yourhostname:portnum

    where <yourhostname> is your hostname and <portnum> is the desired port
    you wish to run the server.  These are the same values you placed in
    lbone_cgi_base.h

  DATABASE:
    After starting your slapd server, you may wish to populate the ldap
    database with the location information of your area.  Provided are
    zipcodes within the US, and airport codes from around the world.

    As a minimum, you will need to add the root.ldif definitions.  These
    providea 'root directory' to add zipcodes, or country codes, or whatever
    you'd like later.  This is done as follows:

    ldapadd -x -wlbone -H ldap://yourhost.name:<portnum> -D "cn=root,o=lbone" \
                -f root.ldif

    continue with as many of the ldif files as you'd like. Some provide only a
    template of possible information. For instance,

    ldapadd -x -wlbone -H ldap://yourhost.name:6776 -D "cn=root,o=lbone" \
                -f zips.ldif

    To verify that the data has been added, you may check with ldapsearch.

    ldapsearch -x -h <yourldapserver>:<portnum> -w '<yourpasswd>' -b 'o=lbone' \
            -LLL "(objectclass=*)"

    This will dump everything under Organization lbone. You may further
    restrict the search by zipcodes, for example, by changing the 'base dn'
    (or base distinguished name, in ldap parlance).

    ldapsearch -x -h <yourldapserver>:<portnum> -w '<yourpasswd>' \
            -b 'ou=zipcodes,o=lbone' -LLL "(objectclass=*)"

    This is analogous to moving up in a filesystem hierarchy.  In a unix like
    fs, you would have /lbone/zipcodes/zip. In ldap, the hierarcy is read
    right to left, rather than left to right.


LBONE CONFIGURATION:
  WEB:
    After starting the slapd server you should now be able to add depots via the
    cgi page. lbone_list_view.cgi will be empty, but click 'Add A Depot' and
    enter the information it asks.

    You will want to enter at least one valid depot before starting the
    lbone_server.

  LBONE SERVER:
  options:
     [-cp <path>]      : the absolute path to find the config file
     [-lh <ldap host>] : the ldap server to use
     [-p  <port>]      : the port to use [1024 < port < 65353]
     [-no-poll]        : do not poll the depots to update the ldap server
                         (for use with slave ldap servers)
     
     lbone_server -cp /absolute/path/lbone.cfg -pw <your ldap passwd>

     the provided lbone.cfg should be altered to reflect your hostnames.

  SHUTDOWN:
     To safely shutdown the ldap server send it the INT signal via 'kill' or
     some other signal sender thingy. You risk loss or corruption of your lbone
     database otherwise. 

     The lbone_server, on the otherhand, is stateless.  Kill it by any means
     you see necessary or appropriate.  You risk losing no data.
