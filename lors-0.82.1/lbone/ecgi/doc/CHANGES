0.6.2
-----
- added comments headers to files - juhuu!
- copied gpl to doc/COPYING
- fixed bug in html2h - input files where also parsed in comments
13.02.2001
- there was only ONE untouched function from cgic 0.5 left in my ecgi lib,
  and this bastard function had an segfault in it (which occured only
  VERY rarely) - thanks to "Bao C. Ha" <bao@hacom.net> for showing me.
  (who also maintains a ecgi debian package now ...)
- fixed a bug in memfile.h, where i used a "va_list *ap" instead of a
  "va_list ap" - how silly ...
  thanks to Ramon Poca <ramon@tau.uab.es> for telling me
- ecgitk uses time.h - added an "#include <time.h>", so you dont have to
  include it in your programm

0.6.1
------
08.12.2000
- compiled now on solaris - fixed some segfaulting typecasts.
- added: html2h preprozessor now finds HTML input tags and adds them to
  the .h header - so you allways know, what names to ask for with cgiParam(),
  when getting input from a template
- "ANSI-CLEANED" the sources by changing some things after invoking gcc
  with -ansi and -pedantic - changed all // to /* .. */ - ANSI-PROVED now :)
- cleaned up Makefile - ie: if the "gcc --shared" fails now, this happens
  as the last thing - should not make any real problems, since libecgi.a
  should be generated then
- replaced setenv() with putenv() in loadDebugData(), because setenv is not
  supported on solaris (why ever)
- read basics about "autoconf" and decided NOT to do this myself, since my
  focus is c-programming!

0.6 Initial Release 
-------------------
December 2000
- rewrote complete source from Todor Prokopov - only 1 untouched function 
  in the sources - added new functions for file handling, for accessing all 
  objects without the name and saving/loading the whole environment for 
  debugging.
06.12.2000
- added mfFileToMFileN()
- cgiLoadDebugData() and cgiSaveDebugData() functions work now
- mfprintf()  added to memory files
- added "make install" to the Makefile (it creates a .a ar 
  archive and a .so lib now)
- html2h preprozessor added
- added first functions to ecgitk - eCgiToolkit
