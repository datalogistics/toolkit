The documentation is in the ecgitut.* files.

Since i made the main doku in word .doc format, i have
- aemm - some problems to convert it. The html, which
is converted by word, is a pain in the ****. And i didnt
find any way to export it to clean html with an external tool.
I cleaned up the wordhtml with dreamweaver, but the result
was not satisfactory.

So, you currently have a .doc word file, a .txt text file,
a .htm - pain in the **** - html file and a .rtf rich text
format file (rtf without index). choose whatevery you like.

If you have any ideas, how to get better html output, please 
email me.

I will add a pdf later, but no time for this now.
