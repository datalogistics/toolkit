QUICK NOTE:
-----------
- you MUST have:
  strdup(), strncasecmp(), strcasecmp(), putenv(), vsnprintf(), snprintf()
  installed on your system to make ecgilib compile
- "gcc --shared" fails on some systems - ignore this and make a simple
  "make install" - you should have the libecgi.a then
- some systems need "gcc -G" instead - changed SHAREDOPT in Makefile to -G

INSTALL
-------
just type "make" and "make install" in the main dir.
if you dont want ecgilib to install to /usr/bin, /usr/include, /usr/lib,
change the Makefile.

HELP
----
If anyone has experience with autoconf and wants to help me: great!
especially interesting would be the part, how to put the functions mentioned
above to not error on specific compilers
