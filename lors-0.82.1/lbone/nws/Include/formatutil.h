** This package provides utilities for translating between host and network
** data formats.  It may be thought of as an extention of the Unix {hn}to{nh}*
** functions or as a lightweight version of XDR.  It handles big-to-little
** endian translations, integer size discrepencies, and conversions to/from
** IEEE floating point format.  It does *not* presently handle either non-two's
** complement integer formats or mixed-endian (e.g., little endian bytes, big
** endian words) ordering.  These are so rare and generally archaic that
** handling them seems not worth the added code.  Note: compiling the body of
** this package with NORMAL_FP_FORMAT defined will yield a tiny performance
** improvement and a small savings in code size by eliminating the IEEE
** conversion code.
