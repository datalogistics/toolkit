Building NWS
------------

The NWS build process attempts to automatically configure the sources to work
with a variety of Unix systems.  To build the NWS binaries, it should suffice
to:

  cd <NWS root>
  ./configure
  make

where <NWS root> is the NWS source root directory.  Send mail to
swany@cs.utk.edu if you experience difficulties building the binaries.  After
the above steps, you can execute

  make install

to collect the NWS binaries into a single installation directory.  This
directory defaults to be <NWS root>/<os>/bin, where <os> is solaris, linux,
aix, irix, hpux, or some other designation of your operating system.  If you
want the binaries placed elsewhere, use a --prefix switch when you run the
configure program to specify the installation root directory:

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/WhereIPutNWS

In this example, "make install" would leave a copy of the NWS executables in
$HOME/WhereIPutNWS/bin.  In addition to collecting the NWS executables, "make
install" also creates the subdirectories doc/, examples/, include/, lib/, and
(optionally) java/ in the installation directory.

configure takes a number of other standard options, few of which are likely to
be useful to you.  For a complete list, see the GNU autoconf documentation, or
enter

  ./configure --help

on the command line.  The NWS configuration script recognizes four options in
addition to the standard ones:

  --disable-debug
        Compile without the -g switch.

  --enable-java
        The JavaProtocol subdirectory contains a set of Java classes that
        speak the NWS client protocols.  Using these classes, you can perform
        any of the tasks that the NWS command line tools like nws_extract,
        nws_search, and ctrl_host perform.  To obtain compiled versions of
        these classes, use the --enable-java configure option.  The NWS make
        procedure will then compile the Java files into .class files and
        combine them into a nwsclasses.zip file.  "make install" will copy this
        file to your installation directory.  If you have JDK 1.2 installed,
        "make install" will also use javadoc to produce a set of HTML
        documentation for the NWS JavaProtocol classes.

  --enable-profiling
        Compile and link with the -p switch (-pg if using gcc).

  --with-purify=<dir>
        If you have Rational Software's purify package installed, you can use
        it to link the NWS binaries to detect memory access errors.  Use the
        --with-purify configure option to specify the root directory of the
        purify installation, then execute "make pure".  This will produce
        purify-linked versions of all the NWS executables.
